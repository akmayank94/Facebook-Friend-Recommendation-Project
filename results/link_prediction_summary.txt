PHASE 4: LINK PREDICTION SUMMARY
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Predict which non-connected users are likely to become friends in future,
using similarity measures and community information.

DATASET:
Training Network: 4039 nodes, 70588 edges
Test Edges (Ground Truth): 17646 edges
Candidate Pairs (Non-edges): 88230 sampled pairs

LINK PREDICTION METHODS (Ch. 2.3-2.4, 4.5):
================================================================================

1. COMMON NEIGHBORS (CNN)
   Score: Count of shared friends
   Performance: 34.9359 (true), 0.4629 (false)

2. JACCARD COEFFICIENT
   Score: Fraction of union that are common neighbors
   Range: 0-1
   Performance: 0.2757 (true), 0.0066 (false)

3. ADAMIC-ADAR INDEX
   Score: Weighted sum of 1/log(degree) for common neighbors
   Performance: 7.7548 (true), 0.0967 (false)

4. PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT
   Score: Product of degrees (rich get richer)
   Performance: 7651.4986 (true), 1169.6354 (false)

ENSEMBLE METHODS:
================================================================================

1. COMBINED SCORE (Average of 4 methods)
   Average true score: 0.1808
   Average false score: 0.0049

2. COMMUNITY BOOST (1.5x multiplier if same community)
   Average true score: 0.4455
   Average false score: 0.0087
   Improvement: 146.33%

KEY FINDINGS:
================================================================================

1. All methods show clear separation between true and false edges
   → True edges have higher scores than false edges

2. Community information BOOSTS prediction accuracy
   → 95.8% of test edges are within same community

3. Adamic-Adar Index often performs best
   → Emphasizes rare common neighbors

4. Preferential Attachment shows different pattern
   → Captures high-degree node connections

INTERPRETATION:
================================================================================

PRECISION@K: What fraction of top-k recommendations are correct?
- High precision means recommendations are reliable
- Precision@20: Focus on top 20 most confident recommendations

RECALL@K: What fraction of all true links are in top-k?
- High recall means we find most of the true connections
- Recall@20: How many of 17,647 test edges can we find in top 20?

AUC-ROC: Overall ranking quality
- Measures ability to rank true edges higher than false edges
- AUC = 0.5 (random), AUC = 1.0 (perfect)

RECOMMENDATION STRATEGY:
================================================================================

Best Approach: Use Community-Boosted Combined Score
Reason: Combines multiple similarity measures + community information

Top Recommendations:
1. Sort by community_boost score
2. Take top-k (e.g., k=20) for each user
3. These are predicted future friends

NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

Phase 5: Final Report
- Compile all phases into comprehensive report
- Include methods, results, visualizations, conclusions
- Present findings on community structure and link prediction
